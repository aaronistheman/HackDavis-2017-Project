This is a project for the HackDavis 2017 event. As per the event's
rules, we had 24 hours to attempt this application.

It's a web application intended to help children with ADHD to focus
and relax. It aims for this through two main features: 1) three games,
2) a checklist feature that would (in theory) be used by the parents/guardians
to remind their child of certain things to do (e.g. bring an instrument
to school).
